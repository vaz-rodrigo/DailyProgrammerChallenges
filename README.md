# DailyProgrammerChallenges

This repo contains all of the challenges from [**r/dailyprogrammer**](http://reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) and also scripts used to pull challenges from the subreddit each week and to cleanup the directory of any posts that were pulled unnecessarily.

The [**post-challenges.py**](https://github.com/FreddieV4/DailyProgrammerChallenges/blob/master/post-challenges.py) script is ran via a cron job on a VPS at the end of each week, and then automatically pushes that week's challenges to this repository. **The script is pretty inefficient, but it gets the job done. If you see ways to improve it, feel free to submit a pull request and add your name as a contributor below!**

## Required Modules:
